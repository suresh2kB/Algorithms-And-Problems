# Graph-Algorithms

Graph algorithms are a set of computational procedures that operate on graphs or networks. These algorithms are used to solve various problems related to graph theory, such as finding the shortest path between two nodes, identifying connected components, detecting cycles, and optimizing network flow. Some popular graph algorithms include Dijkstra's algorithm, Bellman-Ford algorithm, Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Prim's algorithm, Kruskal's algorithm, and the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.
